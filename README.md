Predicting Animal Species

An important aspect of studies done on animals is the recording and catalogging of a variety of different species of a specific animal. This type of resarch allows us to analyze the ways in which different species vary in specific physiological and environmental features. From this research, I can make predictions about the species of an animal based soley on these catalogged features. In this report, I will focus on a study conducted in Antartica that recorded a variety of physical and environmental features of three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. 

Using this study, I want to find a robust way of predicting the species of a penguin based upon its physical and environmental features. In order to do this, I am going to first conduct an exploratory analysis where I observe the relationships between different features and the three species of penguins. Utilizing this analysis, I will select two quantitative features and one qualitative feature that I believe can be used to make accurate predictions of the type of species of a given penguin. 

To accomplish this, I am going to deploy and train three seperate machine learning models that can use the features I provide them to make accurate predictions about the species of each penguin. I will then compare each model's accuracy and select the model that makes the best predictions. Throught this report, I want to provide a tutorial on the usage and mechanics of machine learning models as well as the advantages and possible limitations they present.
